# Comparison of Cognitive Statement Ontology (CSO) with Other Ontologies

## AIF (Argument Interchange Format)

- AIF is focused on formalizing arguments (dividing arguments into support schemes (RA), counterarguments (CA), preferences (PA)). A model for denoting refutations, attacks, and preferences.
- No explicit representation of sources, quotes, or credibility. Cognitive bias is not represented as a separate node.

## Toulmin Model

- The Toulmin model focuses on argument structure (Claim, Data, Warrant, Backing, Qualifier, Rebuttal). Statements in this model can be transformed into descriptions using the Cognitive Statement Ontology (CSO) with minimal assumptions.
- No fixation of thinking errors for each component of the model
- Focus on methodology for building quality argumentation
- Overloaded visualization with large amounts of data (unlike the CSO)

## General Differences Between Existing Ontologies and CSO

The described ontologies are poorly suited for "human-centered" analysis and are oriented more towards argumentative logic than towards analyzing the psychology of thinking.
