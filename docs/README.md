# Cognitive Ontology

Welcome to the Cognitive Statement Ontology project!

## Overview

This project provides a framework for analyzing and visualizing cognitive statements, their relationships, and the cognitive biases that influence them. The ontology helps in understanding how statements are connected to cognitive biases and how they can be evaluated for credibility.

## Structure

- `ontology/` — core ontology definitions and rules
  - `notations/` — different visualization notations
  - `examples/` — example data files
- `docs/` — project documentation
  - [Definition and Scope](definition.md)
  - [Ontology Rules](rules.md)
  - [Use Cases](use_cases.md)
  - [Working with Cognitive Biases](cognitive_biases.md)
  - [Statement Credibility Assessment](credibility.md)
  - [Notation Comparison](comparison.md)
- `tools/` — visualization and analysis tools
  - [Technical Documentation](tools/README.md)

## Supported Notations

The project supports multiple visualization notations to represent cognitive statements and their relationships:

- [Sequential notation](ontology/notations/sequential_notation.md) — linear representation of statements and their connections
- [Context notation](ontology/notations/context_notation.md) — shows statements in the context of cognitive biases
- [Bias-oriented notation](ontology/notations/bias_notation.md) — focuses on relationships between cognitive biases
