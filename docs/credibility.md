# Credibility Assessment

Each statement can have one of the following credibility levels:

- **green** — credible (confirmed)
- **yellow** — controversial (requires verification)
- **red** — not credible (refuted)
- **gray** — uncertain

Color-coded assessment of statements is only used in the sequential notation.

Each statement is assessed by an expert.

When preparing a CSO description, the expert identifies cognitive biases and their influence on statements based on their knowledge.
