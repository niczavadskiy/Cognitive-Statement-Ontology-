# Working with Cognitive Biases

## Definition of Cognitive Biases

If you haven't encountered the task of identifying cognitive biases before, we recommend using the collection in [Bias Codex](https://www.biascodex.com/). For description in the Cognitive Statement Ontology (CSO), any set of cognitive biases can be used at the researcher's discretion.

Bias Codex provides:
- Detailed descriptions of various types of cognitive biases
- Examples of bias manifestations in real life
- Strategies for overcoming biases
- Categorization of biases by application areas

## Representation in Notations

Cognitive biases are represented in all three notations of the Cognitive Statement Ontology (CSO):

### Hierarchical Notation
- Biases are displayed at the top of the graph
- Connected to statements through directed links
- Allows tracking the influence of biases on statements

### Context Notation
- Biases are represented as columns
- Statements can be connected to multiple biases
- Allows analyzing the context of bias influence

### Bias-oriented Notation
- Biases are represented as colored blocks
- Statements are placed inside bias blocks
- Shows connections between biases through common statements

## Usage Recommendations

1. **Notation Selection**:
   - Use hierarchical notation for analyzing bias influence
   - Apply context notation for studying interrelationships
   - Choose bias-oriented notation for detailed analysis of specific biases

2. **Bias Identification**:
   - Start by identifying main biases in the research area
   - Use Bias Codex to find and describe biases
   - Document connections between biases and statements

3. **Influence Analysis**:
   - Track direct and indirect bias influences
   - Analyze relationships between different biases
   - Evaluate influence strength through number of connections
